# Project for ELEC391 - Project course in 3rd year
Robot arm to pick marshmellows at certain location.

This was a group project done among 3 members including myself.

I pesonally was responsible for developing the PCB for driving 4 different motors and software implementations of the PID controller in C for the arduino and in MATLAB/Simulink for simulation purposes. The controller incorporates a filtered derivative for better accuracy. Due to the remote nature of the project, I also learned to connect Simulink to a simulation software called SimulationX that helped us design and simulate how the designed robotic arm would fare at grabbing marshmellows had it been completely realized.
